# `Sliding Puzzle`
#### "Sliding Puzzle" is a game in which you need to arrange buttons with numbers in ascending order. One of the buttons is missing and this empty space should be at the end. The player can only move the adjacent button to the place of the empty one. The player wins when order is restored.

#### To open the game, you need to open the "Sliding Puzzle Project.exe" file.

#### First, you need to choose the size of the board: 4\*4 (write 4) or 5\*5 (write 5). Then press "Enter". The game will start.

#### To move through the cells, use the following keys:
#### "W" or "UpArrow" to move up.
#### "S" or "DownArrow" to move down.
#### "D" or "RightArrow"to move right.
#### "A" or "LeftArrow" to move left.

#### To move the button to an empty place, move to the selected button and press "F" or "Enter".

#### Good luck!
